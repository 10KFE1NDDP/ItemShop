# Information

- Want to find other ID's that you may not be able to get from [fortnite.gg](https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics)? Use [FModel](https://fmodel.app/)! You can grab ID's such as Beyond Series emotes using it. If you would like to learn the basics of FModel, I recommend [this tutorial by IFireMonkey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD2zqOyw7ZI)

# Rules

- No extremely rare or exclusive skins such as Renegade Raider, Ikonik & Scenario, Raider's Revenge, etc. We will choose when to release these, not the player. An item shop with a ton of rare cosmetics will 100% get denied.
- We recommend you make the shops realistic-ish to how they are in Fortnite itself. Prices can be changed a slight bit depending on the cosmetic, and how it's percieved from the community, but nothing extreme, like a legendary skin going for 400 V-Bucks.
